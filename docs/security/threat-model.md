# Threat Model

This page outlines Relock's security assumptions, threat model, and risk analysis. Understanding these security boundaries helps you make informed decisions about deployment and integration.

## Security Assumptions

### Trusted Components

Relock assumes the following components are trustworthy:

- **Relock Infrastructure**: The Relock service and its cryptographic operations
- **TLS/HTTPS**: Transport layer security between client and server
- **Browser Security**: Modern browser security features and sandboxing
- **Origin Isolation**: Same-origin policy enforcement

### Threat Assumptions

Relock is designed to protect against:

- **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle, replay, and traffic analysis
- **Session Hijacking**: Stolen cookies, tokens, or session identifiers
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery**: Unauthorized actions using authenticated sessions
- **Phishing**: Fake websites attempting to steal credentials
- **Device Compromise**: Stolen or compromised devices

## Attack Vectors

### 1. Network Layer Attacks

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM)
- **Risk**: High
- **Mitigation**: TLS 1.3, certificate pinning, origin binding
- **Relock Protection**: Origin binding prevents requests from unauthorized domains

#### Traffic Analysis
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Request-level authentication, no persistent identifiers
- **Relock Protection**: Each request requires fresh cryptographic proof

#### Replay Attacks
- **Risk**: High
- **Mitigation**: Signed One-Time Tokens (SOTT), timestamp validation
- **Relock Protection**: SOTT ensures each token can only be used once

### 2. Application Layer Attacks

#### Session Hijacking
- **Risk**: High
- **Mitigation**: Continuous authentication, cryptographic proofs
- **Relock Protection**: Replaces bearer tokens with per-request validation

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Origin binding, cryptographic validation
- **Relock Protection**: Origin binding prevents cross-origin attacks

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Content Security Policy, input validation
- **Relock Protection**: Limited - XSS can still compromise user sessions

### 3. Client-Side Attacks

#### Malware/Keyloggers
- **Risk**: High
- **Mitigation**: Device binding, behavioral analysis
- **Relock Protection**: Device binding detects unauthorized access

#### Browser Extensions
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Origin isolation, sandboxing
- **Relock Protection**: Origin binding limits extension access

#### Device Theft
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Device binding, automatic key rotation
- **Relock Protection**: Device binding detects new devices

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios

1. **Compromised Relock Infrastructure**
   - Impact: Complete system compromise
   - Mitigation: Multi-tenant isolation, security audits
   - Detection: Monitoring, anomaly detection

2. **TLS Certificate Compromise**
   - Impact: Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Mitigation: Certificate pinning, HSTS
   - Detection: Certificate transparency logs

3. **Client Device Compromise**
   - Impact: Unauthorized access to user accounts
   - Mitigation: Device binding, behavioral analysis
   - Detection: Anomaly detection, user reporting

### Medium Risk Scenarios

1. **Browser Vulnerabilities**
   - Impact: Sandbox escape, origin bypass
   - Mitigation: Regular updates, security headers
   - Detection: Security monitoring, vulnerability scanning

2. **Social Engineering**
   - Impact: User credential theft
   - Mitigation: User education, multi-factor authentication
   - Detection: User reporting, anomaly detection

3. **Supply Chain Attacks**
   - Impact: Compromised dependencies
   - Mitigation: Dependency scanning, integrity checks
   - Detection: Automated scanning, security audits

### Low Risk Scenarios

1. **Brute Force Attacks**
   - Impact: Account compromise
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, account lockout
   - Detection: Rate limiting, monitoring

2. **Information Disclosure**
   - Impact: Sensitive data exposure
   - Mitigation: Minimal data collection, encryption
   - Detection: Data loss prevention, monitoring

## Security Boundaries

### What Relock Protects

- **Authentication**: Continuous cryptographic validation
- **Session Security**: Per-request authentication
- **Origin Binding**: Domain-specific access control
- **Device Binding**: Device-specific authentication
- **Replay Prevention**: One-time token validation

### What Relock Doesn't Protect

- **Application Logic**: Business logic vulnerabilities
- **Data Storage**: Database security and encryption
- **User Input**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Access Control**: Authorization and permissions
- **Infrastructure**: Server and network security

## Defense in Depth

### Primary Defenses

1. **Cryptographic Authentication**: Strong cryptographic proofs
2. **Origin Binding**: Domain-specific access control
3. **Device Binding**: Device-specific authentication
4. **Replay Prevention**: One-time token validation

### Secondary Defenses

1. **TLS/HTTPS**: Transport layer security
2. **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
3. **Input Validation**: Request parameter validation
4. **Rate Limiting**: Abuse prevention

### Tertiary Defenses

1. **Monitoring**: Security event logging
2. **Alerting**: Automated threat detection
3. **Incident Response**: Security incident procedures
4. **Regular Audits**: Security assessment and testing

## Threat Modeling Process

### 1. Asset Identification

Identify critical assets:
- User authentication data
- Cryptographic keys
- Session information
- API endpoints

### 2. Threat Enumeration

List potential threats:
- Authentication bypass
- Session hijacking
- Data exfiltration
- Service disruption

### 3. Risk Assessment

Evaluate threat likelihood and impact:
- **Likelihood**: Frequency of attack attempts
- **Impact**: Severity of successful attack
- **Risk Score**: Likelihood Ã— Impact

### 4. Mitigation Planning

Develop countermeasures:
- **Prevention**: Reduce attack likelihood
- **Detection**: Identify attack attempts
- **Response**: Contain and recover from attacks

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
