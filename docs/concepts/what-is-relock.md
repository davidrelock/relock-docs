# What is Relock?

Relock is an advanced software cryptographic authenticator that provides **continuous passive authentication** with zero user friction. It replaces traditional bearer authentication with per-request cryptographic proofs, delivering enterprise-grade security without compromising user experience.

## The Problem with Traditional Authentication

Traditional web authentication relies on **bearer credentials** - secrets that grant access to anyone who possesses them:

- **Passwords**: Whoever knows the password can sign in
- **Session cookies**: Whoever has the cookie can act as the user
- **Bearer tokens**: Whoever possesses the token gets access
- **OTP codes**: Whoever enters the code is authenticated

:::warning Bearer Authentication Risk
Once an attacker steals a bearer credential, they can fully bypass all login protections and impersonate the user.
:::

### Common Attack Vectors

- **Session hijacking**: Stolen cookies bypass MFA
- **Token replay**: Captured tokens used multiple times
- **Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)**: Real-time credential interception
- **Credential stuffing**: Reused passwords across sites

## Relock's Solution: Continuous Cryptographic Trust

Relock shifts from **one-time login security** to **continuous request-level protection**:

### Core Principles

1. **Per-Request Validation**: Every request must prove device identity
2. **Cryptographic Proofs**: No reusable secrets, only one-time tokens
3. **Origin Binding**: Tokens are valid only from the enrolled browser
4. **Continuous Rotation**: Keys rotate automatically to prevent reuse

### How It Works

Instead of "whoever has the token can act as the user," Relock enforces "every request must prove the origin-bound, continuous cryptographic relationship."

## Key Benefits

### üîí Continuous Trust
- **Every request validated**: No single point of failure
- **Real-time compromise detection**: Immediate session termination
- **Session integrity**: Protection throughout the entire session

### üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Resistance
- **Cookie theft neutralized**: Stolen sessions are useless
- **Token replay prevention**: Each proof is single-use
- **AiTM protection**: Real-time interception is detected

### ‚ö° Zero Friction
- **Invisible protection**: Users see no additional steps
- **No user gestures**: Protection runs in the background
- **Seamless experience**: Maintains existing UX patterns

### üöÄ Easy Deployment
- **Lightweight integration**: Minimal code changes required
- **Cloud-hosted**: No infrastructure to manage
- **Multiple options**: Choose your integration complexity

## Technical Architecture

### Relock Tesseract

The core of Relock's system is the **Tesseract** - a symmetric key wrapped in interdependent encryption:

- **Client-side encryption**: Secret encrypted with server-only key
- **Server-side encryption**: Secret encrypted with client-only key
- **Browser binding**: Additional fingerprint and randomization
- **Memory-only access**: Raw secrets never stored unencrypted

### Four-Axis Binding

Trust is bound along multiple dimensions:

1. **Device**: Browser sandbox and OS keychain
2. **Server**: Relock gateway authentication
3. **Origin**: Domain and protocol enforcement
4. **Time**: Automatic key rotation cadence

### Signed One-Time Tokens (SOTT)

Each request carries a fresh cryptographic proof:

- **Derived from Tesseract**: Unique per request
- **Origin-bound**: Valid only from enrolled browser
- **Single-use**: Cannot be replayed or reused
- **Cryptographically signed**: Tamper-proof verification
